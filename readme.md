### Mandou, Apagou (ErasingEvidence)

---

** The bot is currently offline **

"Mandou, Apagou" (ErasingEvidence in english), is a bot that deletes messages in a specific channel of a Discord server. The bot uses discord.py (Python, obviously) and used to be deployed on Heroku (shut down due to financial reasons). The channels and time-until-deletion are stored in a PostgreSQL database and persists even after downtime.

If you want to give this guy a try (after I deploy him somewhere free), just follow the steps:

* Invite it to your server using this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1170832025071140864&permissions=9216&scope=bot);
* Give it permission to see, write and delete messages of the channel that you want the messages to be deleted;
* Write "!eraseevidence [seconds]" (without the brackets) in the channel;
* If your message is deleted and the bot writes "You haven't seen nothing!", then is all set!
* If you want to disable it, just write !eraseevidence again.
